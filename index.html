<div class="about-text">
  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>My name is Rabea.
  I'm a software engineer. 👩‍💻 </p>
  <p>I currently work as a full stack JavaScript developer at <a href="http://engineering.tes.com/" target="_blank">Tes</a>.
  We work remotely and I love the flexibility.</p>
  <p>Before that I spent three years at <a href="http://8thlight.com/" target="_blank">8th Light</a>, a fantastic software consulting company in London.
  </p>
  <p>Currently I feel most comfortable writing TypeScript, JavaScript/Node, Ruby and Java. But I've dabbled in other languages, too.</p>
  <p>I'm passionate about making the tech industry more inclusive, so in my freetime I teach at <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/" target="_blank">Code First: Girls</a>.
