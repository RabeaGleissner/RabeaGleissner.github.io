<div class="about-text">
  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>My name is Rabea and I'm a London based software developer.
  I currently work at <a href="https://8thlight.com/locations/london" target="_blank">8th Light</a>, a software consulting company.
  We love writing high quality code and follow the principles of the <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/" target="_blank">Software Craftsmanship Manifesto</a>.
  Teaching is a really important part of our culture.
  </p>
  <p>
  I'm passionate about making the tech industry more inclusive, so in my freetime I help organise the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/" target="_blank">Ladies of Code meetup</a> and coach at <a href="https://codebar.io/" target="_blank">Codebar</a>.
  </p>
  <p>I got into programming by completing an <a href="https://rabeameetscode.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">immersive web development  bootcamp</a> a couple of years ago.</p>
  <p>My prior career was in digital marketing where I managed web development projects, optimised SEO, talked social media strategies and measured ROI.
  I worked a lot with developers and always felt that their work seemed much more exciting than mine, so I finally found the courage to change careers. And I'm so glad I did!</p>
