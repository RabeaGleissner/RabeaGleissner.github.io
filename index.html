  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>My name is Rabea and I'm a London based aspiring software craftsman. I currently work as a resident apprentice at 8th Light, a software consulting company. I also help organise the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-UK/" target="_blank">Ladies Who Code meetup</a> and coach at <a href="https://codebar.io/" target="_blank">Codebar</a>.</p>
  <p>I'm relatively new to the world of programming and completed an <a href="https://rabeameetscode.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">immersive web development  bootcamp</a> to get started in the industry.</p>
  <p>My prior career was in digital marketing where I managed web development projects, optimised SEO, talked social media strategies and measured ROI. I worked a lot with developers and always felt that their work seemed a lot more exciting than mine, so I finally took the plunge to change careers. And I'm so glad I did!</p>
