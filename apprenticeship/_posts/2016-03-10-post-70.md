Today I tidied up my Ruby multiplication generator application a bit more (thanks Maël for pointing out that the puts method was in the wrong class!).

<!--break-->

I also did some more vim/tmux setup. I feel like at the moment I can hardly concentrate on the code because there’s always something vim related to learn/fix/setup. Hopefully this will settle down in a few days or so and I can focus on the code better. I still haven't quite figured out how to make my tests run  using vim-dispatch...

In the afternoon I paired with Jim because I had a few questions about my Java TTT. There were several small issues that I wasn’t happy with and I wanted his advice on how to fix them. Turns out that my design can be improved which I was trying to do for the rest of the afternoon. Firstly I started by implementing a GameFactory which will create the new games instead of them being created in the GameRunner.

I’ve been trying to implement this for over an hour now and I have to change so many things! I really hope this is the right approach and I’m not wasting my time and have to change everything back. If this was Ruby I could just try it out with a couple of files and corresponding tests but unfortunately Java won’t even compile if I don’t change eeeeeverything!
