Felipe was out at a client site yesterday, so I had my IPM with Jim. However, Felipe made a surprise appearance at about 6:30pm and asked me about my IPM and we ended up going through a few things in my code and pairing on some refactoring. It was great!

<!--break-->

Not only because it gave me an excuse not to go to the gym (yessss!) but also because I learnt some stuff.

I had written some slightly complicated code to calculate the winning combinations of my Tic Tac Toe game. Previously I had just hard-coded an array of each line that the board has (vertical, horizontal, diagonal) as winning combinations. Then I checked for each of those lines if index 0 equaled index 1 and index 1 equaled index 2 and if the cells were not empty and then it was a win.

I didn’t want to have the hard coded array anymore, so I changed the code.

However, this lead to a few methods returning Lists inside a List and I already had a hunch that this probably wasn’t the best way of doing it but I didn’t really know how to change it.

Felipe suggested to use an object for each line instead the List of Integer. Ahhh yes, of course! That makes sense because the list of numbers if actually a line!

In the first method the reader of this code just knows that there are one or more lists of numbers inside a big list of numbers. But in the second method the reader knows straight away that it's a list of the lines of the game.

This reminds me of one of my former colleagues, who used to lean back, stroke his beard and say to me: "hardest thing in computer science: naming things...". Ah, Louie. I should check what he's up to these days.

But even though naming things is hard, it definitely pays off because good naming of classes, methods and variables makes the code easier to understand and easier to explain. And if it's easier to understand for developers, they will be able to make changes more quickly and painfree and it is less likely that they will write bugs. 

##Write code with human friendly words

Felipe and Jim both encourage me to write code in a human friendly way. That means choosing method and variable names that make reading the code feel almost like reading normal sentences. And those sentences should be understood by someone who is not a developer. 

To achieve this, Felipe advised me to try to use real life words as much as possible. If I talked about arrays of integers, my mum would have no idea what I mean. But if I talk about a line on a TTT board, she would understand straight away. 

When I'm immersed in a techie world the whole day, it's easy sometimes to forget this reality. And then I need to try to think about what the code that I'm writing describes in the real world.

An example which Felipe gave me and which I thought illustrated it really well, is that if you played Tic Tac Toe the traditional way, on a sheet of paper, you wouldn't call a row a collection of integers. You would just call it a row or a line. And there wouldn't even be any integers. The bits between the pencil drawn lines would just be empty spaces.

##Don't neglect the tests

When I say to write code in a human friendly way, this also includes the tests. I've noticed today that I neglected my tests a little bit in the last round of refactoring. I just ran them and they were all green, so I thought it was fine. But actually, they would have needed some refactoring too, to make them more readable. 

For example, I had a test which I named in a computerish kind of way: 

`returnsAnArrayOfAllEmptyPositions()` 

But really I should have called it `returnsAllEmptyPositions()`. 

Yes, the positions are integers in an array but in the real world that doesn't matter.

Here's an example of another method that I made easier to reason about by simply wrapping code snippets in methods with clear names:

Before it looked like this:

<pre><code class="language-java">
   public Game createGame() {
        GameMode gameMode = userInterface.chooseGameMode();

        if (isHumanVsComputer(gameMode)) {
            return new Game(userInterface, createNewHumanPlayer(), createNewComputerPlayer(), gameManager);
        } else {
            return new Game(userInterface, createNewHumanPlayer(), createNewHumanOpponent(), gameManager);
        }
    }
    
</code></pre>

And now I've changed it to this:

<pre><code class="language-java">
public Game createGame() {
        GameMode gameMode = userInterface.getGameModeFromUser();
        
        if (isHumanVsComputer(gameMode)) {
            return humanVsComputerGame();
        } else {
            return createHumanVsHumanGame();
        }
    }
    
</code></pre>

Felipe also told me an interesting approach whereby the method name should be considered the executive summary of what the method does. And the block of code in the method is when the action is carried out. 

I've previously tried to think of method names as an imperative statement. I imagined how one object would tell another to: `makeAMove()` or `announceGameEnd()`. But I guess the executive summary approach works hand in hand with this.

##Back to the original refactoring challenge

But now let's come back to the transformation of `List<List<Integer>>` into `List<Line>` that we were working on last night.

To achieve this we first added a new `Line` class with a `hasWinner()` method (of course we wrote the tests first). Then we updated all the types for the methods that returned `List<List<Integer>>` to return `List<Line>` instead.

We also had to update the methods that get the rows, columns and diagonals because previously I had iterated over the array of arrays and used the indexes to pull out the cells of the actual board state and then compared them. But now we were getting the lines of the actual board state straight way and checking if any of those lines is a winner.

I think that was the time when Felipe initiated a bet with me. He was confident that all tests would be green. I wasn’t. Even in my short career as a developer, I know that things are never that easy and never *just work*. Yep, and that won me a beer because of course the tests didn’t all pass.

We had to fix the calculations of the methods that got the rows, columns and diagonals.

But then it all worked!

Altogether a successful evening. To sum up the results:

- my code reads much better and is easier to understand

- I learnt some stuff

- I had an excuse not to go to the gym

- I won a beer
