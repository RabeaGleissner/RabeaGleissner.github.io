This week I need to implement the option for a user to play on a 4x4 board instead of a 3x3. Changing the code to add this option wasn’t too bad actually. I’ll write a blog post about the changes I made tomorrow. But for now, I’m just completely shocked by how slow my algorithm is! It’s crazy!

Let’s compare the time it takes for the computer to calculate the first move on a 3x3 board versus a 4x4 board.

## 3x3

## 4x4

476 seconds! That’s almost 8 minutes!

While I was running the test I could tell that my laptop was struggling with all the calculations. It clearly started sweating so it had to turn the fan on - even though our average office temperature is usually what feels like close to  0 °C .

I knew it would be slower but I didn’t realise just how slow it would be!

Part of my story about the 4x4 board is that the first computer move should be faster than 3 seconds. It’s as if Felipe already knew this would happen. Surprise!

So basically I need to get it down from 8 minutes to 3 seconds. I’ve started thinking about some strategies to achieve this.

At the moment, I have an algorithm generate the rows, columns and diagonals of the board and then check if they contain the same marks and are not empty. So maybe I could instead hard code these line arrays for the 4x4 board like I did it in the beginning when I first started with my TTT. Then the algorithm doesn’t need to calculate which ones all the lines are but I can just tell it. I don’t know if that would make such a big difference in speed though. I’d have to try it out.

As an alternative I thought that I could just use a random first move for the computer player. But some first moves are better than others, so I guess that wouldn’t be so clever to sometimes let the computer go first with a bad move.

So what if I just hard code the first move!? That would be super fast. I’d just have to figure out what the ideal first move for a 4x4 board would be. Maybe I’ll wait another 8 minutes and let my laptop sweat to see what it comes up with.

Hm, but is that cheating to hardcode the first move? I mean, the computer should still be unbeatable and the move will be a lot faster than 3 seconds which means that the requirements are definitely fulfilled!
