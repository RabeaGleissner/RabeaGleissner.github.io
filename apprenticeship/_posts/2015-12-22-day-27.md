It's so quiet in the office today! Hardly any of the other companies in our co-working space are around and not many 8th Lighters are in either. 

<!--break-->

But that meant that I got a lot of coding done today because I didn't have many distractions. Even though we took a longer lunch break today to further our American movie education. We ordered pizzas and watched  Office Space!

Most of us including myself had never heard of the film. But Micah referenced it in his presentation last week and I think I've seen gifs with scenes from the movie without actually realising it's from that film. 

And it was so much fun! I really enjoyed the film. It's silly and light hearted. 

During the rest of the day I kept working on my Java Tic Tac Toe game. I could have got it working yesterday without writing the proper tests but noooo... not allowed! It's a bit tricky to test the game loop and I had to remind myself of how to do it. I didn't really understand the approach anymore when I looked at it last night. But luckily the reason for my struggles must have just been the end-of-day tiredness factor rather than my actual inability because when I tackled it again this morning, I figured it out pretty quickly.

To prevent more end-of-day tiredness issues, I better publish this blog post now and go home.
