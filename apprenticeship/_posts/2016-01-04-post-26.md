Last week, during my IPM, Felipe reviewed my Tic Tac Toe code and found a bug within about 2 minutes. Noooooooo! I had 100% test coverage and I'd played the game what felt like a hundred times. I couldn't believe that I missed that one. Oh well, no point in getting annoyed with myself but instead, get debugging!

<!--break-->

##The bug

The application showed an error and quit when Felipe chose position 10 to place his mark on the TTT board. As you can see in the image below, you can only choose a position between 1 and 9.

![big fat error](/../../public/images/error-ttt.png "Java explosion")

The expected behaviour was that when the user entered a wrong number, they would be prompted again to enter the number. Just like it works here for 8000 or for any other number but 10.

##Debugging step 1 - replicate the error

The first thing I did instinctively was to check if I could replicate the error on my machine. Yep, I could. It wasn't Felipe who had hacked my code. Just making sure.

So I went and looked at my code. I knew approximately where the methods were that were called to show the warning about the unavailable position and prompt the user again. 

But Felipe stopped me. He wanted me to take a different approach: write a failing test! Of course, that made sense. I'd have to write a test that failed exactly in the same way that the application failed when the user entered 10.

##Debugging step 2 - write a failing test

So I wrote a test for the getUsersPosition() method in UseInterface. My thinking was that it’s the first method that is called to return a user’s choice, so let’s start there.

<pre><code class="language-java">
@Test
public void returns9whenInputIs10() {
    fakeConsole.userInput("10");
    Board board = new Board();
    assertEquals((Integer) 9, userInterface.getUsersPosition(board));
}

</code></pre>

And this is the corresponding method:

<pre><code class="language-java">
public Integer getUsersPosition(Board board) {
    String userInput = console.readUserInput();
    if (!(inputFormatter.isInteger(userInput)) ) {
        notANumberWarning();
        return returnPlayersChosenPosition(board);
    } else {
        Integer position = Integer.parseInt(userInput);
        return inputFormatter.subtractOneToMatchArrayIndex(position);
    }
}

</code></pre>

And the test passed without any problems! So that can’t have been the issue.

Maybe it would help to actually look at the error message and the stack trace! The error message means that the application is trying to access an element in an array that is not in it. For example it could be looking for the 10 in an array which only goes up to 9.

Looking at the stack trace, I can see that the last method that ran before it blew up was the Board.isPositionAvailable() method. I should have looked at the stack trace a bit more closely in the first place and not waste my time with the other test. You live and learn.

So the next step was to write a test for the method that caused the problem.

<pre><code class="language-java">
@Test
public void checkIf9IsAnAvailablePosition() {
    assertEquals(false, board.isPositionAvailable(9));
}

</code></pre>

And here is the method

<pre><code class="language-java">
public boolean isPositionAvailable(int position) {
    return position >= 0 && position <= cells.length &&
            !(cells[position] == Cell.X || cells[position] == Cell.O);
}

</code></pre>

And now I was able to replicate the error with that test. The application behaved in exactly the same way as when manually entering 10 during a game.

So how to fix it?

Well, I’m checking if the position is greater than or equal to 0 and smaller than or equal to the length of the cells array which is 9. I'm working with an array of cells of 0-8, so when the user enters a number, I subtract one from it to be in line with how indexes in an array work. If the user's chosen position is 10, I subtract one, so it's 9 and the method returns true for 9 - even though there is no 9 in the array. Ooops, I wrote a bug!

It’s easy to fix though - just remove the = sign and make it:

<pre><code class="language-java">
public boolean isPositionAvailable(int position) {
    return position >= 0 && position < cells.length &&
            !(cells[position] == Cell.X || cells[position] == Cell.O);
}

</code></pre>

And this works. All tests pass and when I play the game and enter 10, the application behaves as expected.

Morale of the story? Read the error message properly, follow the stack trace and write a failing test for the method that ran last!
