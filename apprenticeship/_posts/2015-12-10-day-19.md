I wrote a blog post about the [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](/blog/apprenticeship/day-6/) a couple of weeks ago. And then I wrote my first little application in Java and went ahead and violated the principle. Turns out talking about something in theory and actually doing it are two very different things!

<!--break-->

Felipe asked me to talk to a few of my lovely colleagues and ask them how they detect violations of the SRP. I also did some research online.

Firstly, it’s important to be aware of what responsibility a class (or a method for that matter) has. I think that’s where I went wrong because I found it really hard to formulate what the Game class’s responsibility was. The whole application is a game, right? So can I write whatever I want in the Game class as it’s all related to the game? Thinking about it, that would mean in theory I could just add all methods to the Game class and then I wouldn’t really need any other objects, so no point in object oriented design.

Jim gave me the advice to think about it in terms of people. If my application was used in a company, which department would be responsible for which part of the application. 

So in the case of my Game class, the person would probably be the Global Chief Game Strategy Manager. Obvioulsy a very important person with such a long job title.

The Chief Game Strategy Manager is responsible for managing the running of the game, making sure that the right prompts are shown and that the game runs for a certain amount of time and stops under certain conditions. 

So, here is my code. In the beginning I had the following methods in my Game class. (I removed some of the code so the snippet wouldn't get too long.)

<pre><code class="language-java">
public class Game {
	// some setup

	public void play() {
        while (true) {
            Move humanChoice = askPlayerAndReturnChoice();

            if (userQuits(humanChoice)) {
                break;
            }
            playOnce(humanChoice);
        }
    }

    public void playOnce(Move humanChoice) {
       //some code that makes it play
    }

    public Move getUserInput() {
        String move = console.read();
        Move returnedMove = null;
        switch (move) {
            case "R": returnedMove = Move.ROCK;
                break;
            case "S": returnedMove = Move.SCISSORS;
                break;
            case "P": returnedMove = Move.PAPER;
                break;
            case "E": returnedMove = Move.EXIT;
                break;
        }
        return returnedMove;
    }

    private void communicateWinner(Move computerChoice, Rules rules) {
        //some code to commmunicate who the winner is
    }

    private void print(String message) {
        console.print(message);
    }

    private Move askPlayerAndReturnChoice() {
        //some code to print a prompt to ask the user for their choice
        //some code to read what the user typed into the console
    }

    private boolean userQuits(Move humanChoice) {
        //return true if the user wants to quit
    }
}

</code></pre>

Maybe you've already noticed that there are some naughty methods which violate the SRP. 

But what are the best ways to spot violations of the SRP? 

## 1) Red flag: There are several reasons for the class to change

Yep, there are.
At the moment the game plays inifinitely until the user asks to stop. But let's imagine we only want the game to play once and exit. So we have to make a change to the `play()` method in the Game class and remove the while loop. Makes sense.
<pre><code class="language-java">
public void play() {
    while (true) {
        Move humanChoice = askPlayerAndReturnChoice();

        if (userQuits(humanChoice)) {
            break;
        }
        playOnce(humanChoice);
    }
}

</code></pre>

But let's say we also want to change the way that the user communicates with the game. At the moment they enter R for rock, P for paper etc. but now we want to use 1 for rock, 2 for paper and so on. So we need to make a change in the `getUserInput()` method which is also in the Game class. 

<pre><code class="language-java">
public Move getUserInput() {
    String move = console.read();
    Move returnedMove = null;
    switch (move) {
        case "R": returnedMove = Move.ROCK;
            break;
        case "S": returnedMove = Move.SCISSORS;
            break;
        case "P": returnedMove = Move.PAPER;
            break;
        case "E": returnedMove = Move.EXIT;
            break;
    }
    return returnedMove;
}

</code></pre>

A bit weird because how many times the game plays and the keys that the user enters are two unrelated things. So these two methods shouldn't be in the same class.

The same actually goes for the `print()`, `communicateWinner()` and `askPlayerAndReturnChoice()` methods. There is a class called `UserInterface` in the application (not pictured above) which would be a better home for these methods. 

## 2) Red flag: People with different roles request changes and the same class needs to change

This is closely related to the previous recommendation but focuses on people. People are usually the reason why software applications change and the SRP is here for us to make those changes easier. 

To use one of Uncle Bob's examples in a simplified way: There is an Employee class which has the methods `calculatePay()`, `reportHours()` and `save()`. Imagine the COO asks for changes, they will most likely affect the `reportHours()` method. If the CFO asks for changes, they should affect the `calculatePay()` method and should not break the other methods. And if the `save()` method breaks, it's the CTO who gets into trouble. So we want to make sure that if the CFO asks for changes, the CTO doesn't get fired, hence we don't want to touch the `save()` method.

So for my Rock, Paper, Scissors game I've already identified the Global Chief Game Strategy Manager who is responsible for the overall running of the game. There could be a UX Designer, asking for changes to the UI and there could also be the Rule Maker, asking for changes to the rules.

Using the above code as an example again, we could imagine that the UX Designer requests to have a front-end built for the game and no longer just offer the console version. Then I'd have to change things in the Game class, for example this method:

<pre><code class="language-java">
 private void print(String message) {
    console.print(message);
 }
 
</code></pre>

But the UX Designer's changes shouldn't mess with the Game class but only with the UserInterface class. So again, there's clearly something wrong here.

## 3) Red flag: There is an "and" in the method or test name

The SRP doesn't only relate to classes but also to methods. Methods should only do one thing. Having the word "and" in the method name is an indicator that the method has more than one responsibility. 

If we go back to my code, we find this:

<pre><code class="language-java">
private Move askPlayerAndReturnChoice() {
    //some code to print a prompt to ask the user for their choice
    //some code to read what the user typed into the console
}

</code></pre>

Ooops! It does two things. Bad code!


The same goes for tests. If a test has an "and" in the name, it likely means that it tests more than one thing and that in turn is an indication for the test potentially testing a method that does more than one thing!

## 4) Other ways to identify violations

Here are a few other suggestions that I received and researched. 

- if a test or method has more than one block, that could be an indication of a violation of the SRP

- if a method or class is very long, it *can* be an indication for trouble

- if two people are working on unrelated user stories but have to make changes to the same class

- read your own code again closely when you've finished writing a feature by comparing the newly written code to the original code for example by using the diff feature of a pull request


## 5) Happy ending

I'm glad to announce that I managed to tidy up the code and the Game class is now a lot smaller. At the moment it looks something like this (again with some code omitted) with only one public method `play()` and two helper methods.

<pre><code class="language-java">
public class Game {

    public void play() {
        userInterface.chooseLanguage();
        while (true) {
            Move humanChoice = userInterface.humanChoice();

            if (userQuits(humanChoice)) {
                userInterface.sayBye();
                break;
            }
            announceWinner(humanChoice);
        }
    }

    private void announceWinner(Move humanChoice) {
        Move computerChoice = computerPlayer.generateMove();
        Rules rules = new Rules(humanChoice, computerChoice);
        userInterface.communicateWinner(computerChoice, rules);
    }

    private boolean userQuits(Move humanChoice) {
        return humanChoice.equals(Move.EXIT);
    }
}

</code></pre>
