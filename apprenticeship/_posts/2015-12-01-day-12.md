The stories in my iteration for this week include practising a kata, writing a game application and reading a new book.

The kata that I need to learn is the Coin Changer kata. The finished code takes an amount of money and returns an array of the largest coins that the amount can be broken down into.

I remember that I tried to do this in Ruby in about January time this year. I really wanted to use TDD for it (because I'd met Christoph from 8th Light and he told me that it's really important!) but had no idea how to do it and never got very far. It had always been on my to do list to figure it out but something else was always more important.

So yesterday evening I completed it in Java and actually found it quite easy! Unless I'm missing something, the implementation is kind of similar to the Roman Numerals kata. And in fact, it's even a bit simpler as there is only one array that needs to be iterated over.

I need to perform this kata on Friday in front of my colleagues, so I need to practise it a lot more to become faster at it. The target duration of my performance is less than eight minutes. 

Apparently it's customary to have some music in the background when performing a kata. So I need to pick a song for it. Maybe Abba - Money, Money, Money?
