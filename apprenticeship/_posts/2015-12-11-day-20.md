On Thursday morning we had a lesson about the differences between white box and black box testing of software. I didn't know what it was and Mateu did a really good job explaining it using an example with a barista (class) making coffee (with different methods). But in this blog post I wanted to try to explain the concepts with my own example.

<!--break-->

Firstly, what does white box and black box mean? White box refers to a system that we can see the internals of. Black box is a system that we can’t see inside. We only see the output after we give it input.

I got a new phone yesterday, so I thought I’d use that as a code example to explain the difference between these two types of testing. My phone was delivered, then I had to sync all the apps that I had on my old phone, then I had to charge it and finally it was ready to use.

## White box testing

The first code example demonstrates white box testing. As you can see I'm testing every single method and know exactly what it each of them does.

The tests:

<pre><code class="language-java">
public class phoneTest {
    private Phone phone = new Phone();

    @Test
    public void newPhoneIsDelivered() {
        assertThat(phone.deliver()).isInstanceOf(Phone.class);
    }

    @Test
    public void restorePhoneFromBackup() {
        assertEquals(43, phone.appCount());
    }

    @Test
    public void chargePhone() {
        assertEquals(100, phone.charge());
    }

    @Test
    public void phoneIsReadyToUse() {
        assertTrue(phone.readyToUse());
    }
}

</code></pre>

The class:
<pre><code class="language-java">
public class Phone {
    private int appCount = 0, backedUpApps = 43, batteryLevel = 12;
    
    public Phone deliver() {
        return new Phone();
    }

    public int appCount() {
        for (int i = 0; i < backedUpApps; i ++) {
            appCount += 1;
        }
        return appCount;
    }

    public int charge() {
        return batteryLevel += 88;
    }

    public boolean readyToUse() {
       Phone iphone = deliver();
        if (iphone.appCount() == backedUpApps && iphone.charge() >= 50) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

</code></pre>

## Black box testing

Black box testing, in contrast, would only need one test as the code shows below. One test that covers all the other methods but doesn't really know what each method does.

The test:

<pre><code class="language-java">
public class phoneTest {
    private Phone phone = new Phone();

    @Test
    public void phoneIsReadyToUse() {
        assertTrue(phone.readyToUse());
    }
}

</code></pre>

The class:

(Pretty much the same code except that some methods are private.)

<pre><code class="language-java">
public class Phone {
    private int appCount = 0, backedUpApps = 43, batteryLevel = 12;
    
    private Phone deliver() {
        return new Phone();
    }

    private int appCount() {
        for (int i = 0; i < backedUpApps; i ++) {
            appCount += 1;
        }
        return appCount;
    }

    private int charge() {
        return batteryLevel += 88;
    }

    public boolean readyToUse() {
       Phone iphone = deliver();
        if (iphone.appCount() == backedUpApps && iphone.charge() >= 50) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

</code></pre>

So after Mateu had explained it, we naturally asked which one was better. Which one should we use, black box or white box?

The advantages of black box testing are that the code is easier to refactor because the tests are not so specific. You can also see that I made most of the methods private in the black box example. And more private methods equals a smaller class interface equals better code equals happier developer.

But white box testing is often what we do when we test drive our code in smaller steps. And it can also help a lot with debugging. 

So, I guess as with most things, it always depends on what you want to achieve and there is no simple answer to the question which one is better or worse.
