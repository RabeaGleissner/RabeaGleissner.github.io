I said that I would research and write a blog post about each SOLID principle. So far I've only written about three out of the five, so here's a post about the next one: interface segregation.

<!--break-->

Firstly, I think I should clarify that "interface" does not mean "user interface" in this case. In all my applications I've seperated the user interface from the rest of the code. But that's different. That relates to the Single Responsibility principle. 

Interface in this case means the interface of a class. And that consists of all public methods. So all methods that other objects can access. When the class has a ton of public methods, this can also be called a "fat interface". Well, especially during this annual time of New Year's resolutions and January fitness goals we of course want to avoid fat interfaces as much as possible.

So what does this principle mean? According to my go to article about the SOLID principles ("How I explained OOD to my wife" - I'm not sure if the feminists that I follow on Twitter would approve of this but hey... it's well explained and easy to understand!) it means that "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."

OK, sounds reasonable. The goal of this principle is to avoid that classes become too tightly coupled or have too many dependencies. That makes an application easier to test and easiser to maintain.

I read several examples in different articles online and I'll try to create my own example here to illustrate how the interface segregation principle should be implemented.

Imagine someone owns a dog. The dog implements the Pet interface which has methods related to feeding, going for a walk and making a mess.

<pre><code class="language-java">
interface Pet {
    public void demandFood();
    public void demandWalks();
    public void makeAMess();
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-java">
class Dog implements Pet {
    @Override
    public void demandFood() {
        // ask to be fed every so often
    }

    @Override
    public void demandWalks() {
        // ask to go for long walks in the countryside
    }

    @Override
    public void makeAMess() {
        // give the owner something to do when they get home
    }
}
</code></pre>

However, now the dog owner has decided to adopt a cat from the animal shelter. The cat will also implement the Pet interface and therefore the methods related to feeding, making a mess and going for a walk. Hang on... going for a walk? A cat doesn't go for walks! Except in Japan where I've seen people walk their cats in cat strollers but I'm sure that's a whole different application that we need to write for something like that.

So instead we can seperate the Pet interface into two as per the code below.


<pre><code class="language-java">
interface Pet {
    public void demandFood();
    public void makeAMess();
}

interface Walkable {
    public void demandWalks();
}
</code></pre>

The dog can implement both the Pet and the Walkable interface.

<pre><code class="language-java">
class Dog implements Pet, Walkable {
    @Override
    public void demandFood() {
        // ask to be fed every so often
    }

    @Override
    public void demandWalks() {
        // ask to go for long walks in the countryside
    }

    @Override
    public void makeAMess() {
        // give the owner something to do when they get home
    }
}

And the cat only implements the Pet interface.

class Cat implements Pet {
    @Override
    public void demandFood() {
        // do some stuff
    }

    @Override
    public void makeAMess() {
        // give the owner something to do when they get home
    }
}
</code></pre>

If I hadn't seperated the interfaces and made the Cat class implement the Pet interface with all three methods even though the demandWalks() method is completely unnecessary, that would have been a violation of the Interface Segregation principle.
