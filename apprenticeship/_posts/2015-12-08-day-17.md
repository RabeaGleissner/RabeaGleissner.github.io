Yesterday I had my weekly review and proudly presented a working Rock, Paper, Scissors app. In Java, a language that I only started learning three weeks ago!

<!--break-->

Turns out, the code wasn't great. I was so happy that it was working that I possibly neglected the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)... So my Game class did a lot of things that would be better suited to be handled by the UserInterface class. 

I had also coded a little bug when I implemented a last minute idea.  

My tasks for this week include refactoring the game application according to the SRP, fix  the bug (which I've luckily already managed) and implement a German language version of the user interface.

I also have to write a blog post about how to discover violations of the SRP and use examples from my code to show how I fixed it. So that's coming soon! But for now I'll focus on the German implementation of the UI.
