Yesterday Sarah asked me how many of my cob spec tests were green. I wasn’t really sure at that time and I told her that I stopped chasing the green. Instead, I’m trying to focus on writing my code in a way that it is as generic as possible and adheres to the Open/Closed Principle.

<!--break-->

When I wrote the server code the first time around, I was desperate to get my tests green as quickly as possible because I was worried that I wouldn’t manage to get everything done in time. But unfortunately that meant that the tests passed quickly in the beginning but at the end it became harder and harder to implement new responses and make the last few tests pass.

This time, I want it to be the other way around. I want to invest the time in the beginning and write the code in a modular way, so that in the end, I just need to slot in another controller for another route to make more tests pass.

I think I’m on a good way there. I am slightly worried that I won’t be able to finish everything that I have committed to until my IPM today. Luckily Felipe had emphasised in my previous IPM that the design of my code is more important than finishing everything.

So I better get back to it!
