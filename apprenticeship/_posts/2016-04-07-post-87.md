Today I realised that probably for the first time ever, my estimates for my stories this week were a bit too optimistic.

<!--break-->

I  am usually a careful estimator because I’m always worried that I might not be able to finish my stories. But my desire to learn as quickly as I can seems to have gotten the better of me in this week’s IPM.

And on top of that I’m writing a blog post for the 8th Light website. I was going to ask during my IPM if I could get a point for that but completely forgot. Oh well, it's my own fault for having a memory like a sieve.

So today I spent some time working on the blog post, fixing my OCP violation (which I’m also writing a blog post about!) and practising the Bowling Game kata which I need to perform tomorrow afternoon.

I am supposed to get through the kata in under 7 minutes but I don’t think this is going to be possible… I’m at about 10 minutes at the moment. Well, I’ll practise some more tomorrow and then perform it as fast as I can. I already warned Felipe (clients don’t like surprises!) and he said I should still perform it tomorrow and try to get as close as possible to the 7 minute mark.
