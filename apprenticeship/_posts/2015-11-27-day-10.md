This morning I continued working on the echo server application and luckily the implementation of the interface and the Main class were relatively straight forward. 

<!--break-->

Now it's possible to run the Main class in the console and type a word and then see it returned. 

I then spent some time writing the application again, because I wanted to go through each step again to make sure that I understand it. I also tried to make sensible commits with good commit messages.

So I feel that this story is complete. The other larger story that I had in my iteration this week was to create a screen recording of the Roman Numerals kata. 

Solving the kata was a lot easier that the Prime Factors kata last week. I guess mainly because I'm a bit more familiar with Java now. I did a screen recording of my performance of the kata yesterday but there are still a few little glitches. So I tried to do it again several times, but it just ended up getting worse. Maybe I had used up all my concentration during that first recording. I'll try again over the weekend and if I can't improve it, I'll just use the recording I have now. 

I normally have my IPM on Monday afternoon but next Monday the apprentices will take part in an all day workshop. That is why I wanted to make sure to get my stories done before that and luckily it more or less worked out.
