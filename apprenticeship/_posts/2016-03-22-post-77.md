Today Jarkyn gave a great Zagaku on how to create objects in JavaScript. I haven’t really used the prototype function much. In fact, one time was during Global Day of Code Retreat, when I paired with a JS guru. But I didn’t really know what it did and why it is always used.

Jarkyn showed us that you can instantiate a new object without calling prototype. But if we don’t use prototype, then not only the object's data will be duplicated for each new object but also the functions on the object. But if we use prototype, only the references to the functions are copied into the new object. That is a lot more memory friendly.

I didn’t realise that! Very interesting. I’m looking forward to more Zagakus in the series `JS with JS` (JavaScript with Jarkyn Soltobaeva)...
