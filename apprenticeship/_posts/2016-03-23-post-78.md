My computer player was a bit slow to make the first move, so I was set the task to profile my code, see where the bottlenecks are and increase the speed. The first move took approximately 6 seconds.

<!--break-->

So this morning I’ve been doing a lot of waiting around… Waiting around for the profiler to finish running. I think the first run took at least 15 minutes, if not more.

Well, the upside is that it’s quite easy to run your code with the inbuilt Ruby profiler. You just need to add this line above the code that you want to profile:

`require 'profile'`

I then wrote a test which runs the code for calculating the first move for an empty board.

The profiler generated a report which shows how many seconds it took for each method to run, how many calls the code made to the method, the overall percentage of time a particular method was taking and some combinations of these measurements.

I decided to look at the first 15 or so methods for now. These are the methods that take up the most time. I figured if I sped those up, they would make the biggest impact on the overall time spent. "Pick the lowest-hanging fruit", is what consulting-speak calls this, I believe.

So here’s the first report I got.

It looks like the code is taking a lot of time iterating over Arrays with each and comparing numbers. And the methods `all_x` and `all_o` are taking up a lot of time too. 

The `minimax` method which contains my algorithm, currently takes 45.69ms in total.

So I tried to change the methods on the Board class a bit, to see if that would make them faster. Here's the next report (only took 7 minutes this time!):

The `all_x` and `all_o` methods take up a lot smaller percentage of time now compared to the previous report (a bit over 9% before and now approx. 6%). However, I've now got the `all_same_marks?` method taking up more time. 

But it did make the `minimax` method much faster now at 27.80ms. So that's something! But I'm still nowhere near my goal of making the first computer move as fast as 1 second.

I tried again to make the code faster by using different methods and you can see below that the ranking has changed a bit. I got rid of the `all_o` and `all_x` methods completely in my code.

The `minimax` method is only slightly faster but I'm now down to 4 seconds for the calculation of the first computer move. About 2 seconds faster than when I started this morning. 

Jarkyn gave me the tip to use the Gem `ruby-prof` instead or the inbuilt Profiler. And that generates the report so much faster! I should have used it in the first place. That would have saved me a lot of time. You live and learn.

So, how to achieve the goal of 1 second speed? I just feel like there are certain operations that need to be done and I'm shuffling them around between different methods. I managed to make it a bit faster but I didn't achieve the significant speed increasement that I was looking for. 

When I googled around for ways to increase the performance of Ruby code, funnily enough one blog post advised to first and foremost look at optimising algorithms. I think that must be where my problem lies. Somehow my minimax algorithm is too slow - even though I'm already using alpha-beta pruning. 

Or could it be another algorithm? I'm currently calculating the rows, columns and diagonals of the game  (the lines) dynamically. Instead I could hard-code an array of arrays to represent the lines. Although that would mean that the code wouldn't be flexible for other board sizes. That said - for a 4x4 board I would probably have to hard code the game lines anyway because it would be too slow otherwise. And I'm not anticipating to be asked to make it work for a 2x2 board because that is a highly unlikely board size for a Tic Tac Toe game.

This story was time-boxed to half a day - and I've already spent more time on it so I think I'll stop here and work on my other stories. If I find that I still have time at the end of my iteration, I'll have a look at my algorithm.

I have to say that it was a useful learning exercise though. This was the first ever that I thought about performance when writing code!
