I feel like my day today was all over the place but I learnt quite a few new things. Firstly Molly gave a really good Zagaku on Priority Queue and binary heap. I really need to do that online course about data structures (or some other computer sciency course). 

And in the afternoon I first  paired with Sophie on the prime factors kata and then with Priya and Ced on their achievement tracker project.

But first I worked on implementing the Human vs Computer game option in my Java web Tic Tac Toe. Luckily this went smoother than I thought it would, so it gave me some time in the afternoon to pair with the others.

## Tic Tac Toe

For my Human vs Computer TTT I ended up creating a separate route with its own controller. So now I have one controller for the HvH game and one for the HvC game. The only difference between those two controllers is that the HvC one makes a move for the computer as well after the move for the human. 

This is what the HvC controller looks like:

<pre><code class="language-java">
public class TttHumanVsComputerController extends Controller {

    private Board board;

    @Override
    public HttpResponse doGet(HttpRequest request) {
        board = new Board(3);
        return htmlBoard();
    }

    @Override
    public HttpResponse doPost(HttpRequest request) {
        board = board.placeMark(new MoveParser(request.body()).move());
        if (!board.gameOver()) {
            board = board.placeMark(new UnbeatableComputerPlayer(O).getMove(board));
        }
        return htmlBoard();
    }

    private HttpResponse htmlBoard() {
        String html = new TicTacToeHtmlGenerator(new BoardHtml(board, HumanVsComputer)).generate();
        return new HttpResponse(OK, html.getBytes());
    }
}

</code></pre>

And the HvH game controller looks very similar:
 
<pre><code class="language-java">
public class TttHumanVsHumanController extends Controller {

    private Board board;

    @Override
    public HttpResponse doGet(HttpRequest request) {
        board = new Board(3);
        return htmlBoard();
    }

    @Override
    public HttpResponse doPost(HttpRequest request) {
        board = board.placeMark(new MoveParser(request.body()).move());
        return htmlBoard();
    }

    private HttpResponse htmlBoard() {
        String html = new TicTacToeHtmlGenerator(new BoardHtml(board, GameMode.HumanVsHuman)).generate();
        return new HttpResponse(OK, html.getBytes());
    }
}

</code></pre>

Oooops, that's quite a bit of duplication! Maybe I should structure my code differently? Could one controller handle both?

I still need to add a Computer vs Human game option. The easiest way to do this would be to add another Controller for that game mode and make the first computer move when a GET request to the route is made. And the POST response method will be the same as for the HvH game. 

More duplication?! I don't know, I have to think about it. On the one hand, I guess having separate controllers for different game modes is SRP compliant. On the other hand, if I need to change how a move is made, for example, then I would need to change it in three different controllers. 

Ha! Maybe I could have a TicTacToeController from which the controllers for the individual game modes inherit. Like it's currently done for all Controllers, which inherit from one main Controller. Then the separate controllers still exist, so no SRP violations are happening, but there's no code duplication.

I think writing these blog posts really helps me spot issues with my code and come up with solutions. Maybe I'll write all my thoughts down from now on. I could turn out to be a genius as long as I'm writing!

## Pairing on PathMan

Priya and Ced are working together to create an achievments tracker website. Danny asked me today if I could help them with CSS and of course I was up for it. I haven't really done any front end coding for ages, so was looking forward to it. 

I ended up working with them on some JavaScript/jQuery code (and not CSS) but it was really interesting for me to see how to test front end JS with Jasmine. Not something that I've ever done. I'd played around with Jasmine and did a few katas in JavaScript but I didn't know that you could have HTML test doubles, for example. 

And we also had a lot of fun! I'm really looking forward to my pairing tour now. It's so nice to be working together with someone.
