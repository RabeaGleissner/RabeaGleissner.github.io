This morning Felipe very kindly agreed to meet me in the office early, before he started his client work, so that I could ask him some questions with regards to my stories.

First we looked at separating my slower tests from my faster tests and setting Maven up so that the slower tests aren’t run by default. I’d tried different approaches over the last few days but somehow never got it working.

The way we got it working now was by using the Surefire Maven plugin and specifying in the pom to exclude the slower tests when using the default command `mvn test` and only run all tests when using the command `mvn integration-test`. I had to move my two slower tests to a separate file which I called `ComputerPlayerSpeedTest.java` and that’s what Maven is looking for to include or exclude.

The xml code that I added looks like this.

Then I showed Felipe the code that I had written so far for my JavaFX GUI. He didn’t seem too appalled by the code overall, which is a start! Or maybe he just contained himself very well. We talked about my approach and he prompted me to think about a similarity between the class that sets up the GUI and an existing class - which would be the `BoardPainter` and `UserInterface` classes in my case.

The `UserInterface` class only dealt with the command line interface though, so I renamed it to `CommandLineUI`. Then I created a Java interface called `UserInterface`. Maybe I should have called it `UserInterfaceInterface` to make it clearer. Anyway that new Java interface implements the methods for the user interface classes. So `CommandLineUI` implements it and `JavaFXUI` implements it too. Well, once I’ve adjusted the code, it will implement it.

After our daily standup, Mateu offered that he would pair with apprentices if they were interested, so I took him up on the offer and spend an hour working on actual client code. Very exciting! But when I say “working”, it really means that I asked a lot of questions and tried to understand the existing Ruby code, just to then add a couple of tests to it that Mateu would have probably written in 5 minutes. Instead we spend an hour on it. But I found it really beneficial, so I’m glad that he offered. Although I feel like an hour almost isn’t enough time if you're working on a project that you have not been involvd in before. First I had to understand the project, the context of what we were doing and the bit of code that we were working on. So it takes some time to get up to speed.

After lunch I paired with Georgina and helped her create a page for her Instagram photos, just like I did with Priya the other day. Ced has also asked me for help with some front end work for his personal website, so I think we might do that next week for Waza.

Another Waza project that I want to work on today is configuring my git setup a bit better, so that it has prettier colours and more shortcuts. 

And that's the end of yet another 8th Light apprenticeship week. Maybe not the best week I've had so far, so I'm kind of glad it's almost over.
