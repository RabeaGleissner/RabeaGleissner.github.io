I just spent a weekend in lovely Portugal, enjoying the sunshine and the good food. And today I’m finding it a bit difficult to acclimatise to cold, grey London.

Luckily the acclimatisation process was made more comfortable by Christoph’s birthday cake and his wonderful Zagaku about terminal shortcuts.

<!--break-->

The commands that Christoph showed us to save time and key strokes are mainly based on Emacs commands. Ced than mentioned that he just used vim bindings for the command line, which basically have a similar effect as some of the Emacs commands (like jumping between words, deleting the rest of the line or deleting whole words). So I’m thinking, rather than learning more commands, I might also set up vim bindings for my terminal instead.

And apparently you can still use the terminal/Emacs type commands for search and history, so that gives you the best of both worlds, as Sarah put it.

Other than that I’m updating my pull requests from last week. Felipe made several comments with questions and suggestions for improvements, so I’m trying to implement those before my IPM this afternoon.
