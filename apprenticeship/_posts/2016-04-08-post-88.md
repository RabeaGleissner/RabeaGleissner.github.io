As an avid reader of my blog, you will remember, that [applications should be open for extension but closed for modification](day-15).

<!--break-->

This was only the 15th blog post that I wrote, so I’ve known this for a while. However, knowing it in theory and always remembering to implement it in practise are two different things. And that became apparent in my last IPM when Jim and Felipe noticed that I had violated the OCP. It looked like too many things had to change if I wanted to add a new player. And they were right - but only for adding a web player. The console player can be added quite easily. But let me elaborate.

## The discovery

When Jim and Felipe looked at my newly introduced GameOptionsMapper class, they noticed my OCP violation. I was quite happy that I had this brainwave to use a class to store the knowledge about the game options and  to map the user input (1, 2, 3, 4) to the game options as symbols (:HumanVsHuman, :HumanVsComputer, :ComputerVsHuman, :ComputerVsComputer). When I use these options for other methods or tests in my application, I use the symbols  so it’s easier to understand.

This is what the class looked like:

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
class GameOptions
  GAME_OPTIONS = {
    1 => "Human vs Human",
    2 => "Human vs Computer",
    3 => "Computer vs Human"
  }

  def map(user_input)
    case user_input.to_i
    when 1
      :HumanVsHuman
    when 2
      :HumanVsComputer
    when 3
      :ComputerVsHuman
    when 4
      :ComputerVsComputer
    end
  end
end

</code></pre>

The first thing that my mentors noticed was the lack of symmetry between the hash that holds three options and the switch statement that has four options.

I iterate over the hash to display the game options in the console and it had never been a requirement to have a Computer vs Computer game (option 4) in the console, so I only have three options. However, a user can choose option 4 when the game runs as a web application. Hence the fourth option in the switch statement. Therefore they concluded that I had to change my application in more places to add a player. And they were of course correct.

## A half-done job

In my defence I would like to say that I thought about the principle… a bit. OK, it was a half-done job. But adding a new player for the console is relatively straight forward. My task is to add a random player option to my game and I just implemented this option for my console. All I needed to do was to add the new option to the game options hash and to the PlayerFactory. And it worked! Just like that. [Here’s the commit](https://github.com/RabeaGleissner/ruby_tic_tac_toe_II/commit/b8fcc219717d854346ccff79c770b99c99625d76) 

## Adding a random player to the web version

Adding a new game option to the web game is a whole different story though.

I would have to update the application in several places:

- the PlayerFactory _again_ (I have two methods in there, one creating the web players and one creating the console players.)

- the menu web view (should probably be generated dynamically based on the game options hash)


- the web controller (it currently has a conditional statement with a different condition for each game option... So I'd need to add another condition to that statement)

Not ideal! So here's how I set out to rectify this.

## PlayerFactory

### Before

This is what my PlayerFactory looked like. It had two methods - one for creating web players and one for creating console players. This duplication meant that I would have to update both methods to add a new player to the console and web versions of the game.

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
class PlayerFactory
  include Marks

  def create_console_players(game_mode, ui)
    case game_mode
    when :HumanVsHuman
      {Marks::X => HumanConsolePlayer.new(Marks::X, ui), Marks::O => HumanConsolePlayer.new(Marks::O, ui)}
    when :HumanVsComputer
      {Marks::X => HumanConsolePlayer.new(X, ui), O => ComputerPlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    when :ComputerVsHuman
      {Marks::X => ComputerPlayer.new(X), Marks::O => HumanConsolePlayer.new(Marks::O, ui)}
    when :ComputerVsComputer
      {Marks::X => ComputerPlayer.new(X), Marks::O => ComputerPlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    end
  end

  def create_web_players(game_mode)
    case game_mode
    when :HumanVsHuman
      {Marks::X => HumanWebPlayer.new(Marks::X), Marks::O => HumanWebPlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    when :HumanVsComputer
      {Marks::X => HumanWebPlayer.new(Marks::X), Marks::O => ComputerPlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    when :ComputerVsHuman
      {Marks::X => ComputerPlayer.new(Marks::X), Marks::O => HumanWebPlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    when :ComputerVsComputer
      {Marks::X => ComputerPlayer.new(Marks::X), Marks::O => ComputerPlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    end
  end
end

</code></pre>

### After

I implemented just one method which creates players for both game types. To distinguish between console and web human players, a additional parameter needs to be passed in to clarify which game type the players are for.

The new PlayerFactory class looks like the below. Now you just need to add a new option to the `create_players` method. If the game option involves a human, you still need to add two player combinations (one with web human, one with console human). 

From this perspective it would be nice to have a human player class that can play both web and console games. That would make the PlayerFactory class a lot cleaner. But the two player types have to do very different things. If I merged them into one, I think the methods in the class would get quite messy. So I'd rather make this trade off and add two player combinations in the PlayerFactory and keep the human web and console players separate.

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
class PlayerFactory
  include Marks
  attr_reader :app_type

  def initialize(app_type)
    @app_type = app_type
  end

  def create_players(game_mode)
    if game_mode == :HumanVsHuman
      create_human_vs_human_players
    elsif game_mode == :HumanVsComputer
      create_human_vs_computer_players
    elsif game_mode == :ComputerVsHuman
      create_computer_vs_human_players
    elsif game_mode == :ComputerVsComputer
      create_computer_vs_computer_players
    elsif game_mode == :HumanVsRandom
      create_human_vs_random_players
    end
  end

  def create_human_vs_human_players
    if app_type == :console
      {Marks::X => HumanConsolePlayer.new(Marks::X), Marks::O => HumanConsolePlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    elsif app_type == :web
      {Marks::X => HumanWebPlayer.new(Marks::X), Marks::O => HumanWebPlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    end
  end

  def create_human_vs_computer_players
    if app_type == :console
      {Marks::X => HumanConsolePlayer.new(Marks::X), Marks::O => ComputerPlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    elsif app_type == :web
      {Marks::X => HumanWebPlayer.new(Marks::X), Marks::O => ComputerPlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    end
  end

  def create_computer_vs_human_players
    if app_type == :console
      {Marks::X => ComputerPlayer.new(Marks::X), Marks::O => HumanConsolePlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    elsif app_type == :web
      {Marks::X => ComputerPlayer.new(Marks::X), Marks::O => HumanWebPlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    end
  end

  def create_computer_vs_computer_players
    {Marks::X => ComputerPlayer.new(Marks::X), Marks::O => ComputerPlayer.new(Marks::O)}
  end

  def create_human_vs_random_players
    if app_type == :console
      {Marks::X => HumanConsolePlayer.new(Marks::X), Marks::O => RandomPlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    elsif app_type == :web
      {Marks::X => HumanWebPlayer.new(Marks::X), Marks::O => RandomPlayer.new(Marks::O)}
    end
  end
end

## Menu web view

### Before

The menu view had a form with a radio button and a corresponding label for each game option. To add a new game option I could have just copied and pasted one of the previous option and updated the details. 

This is what the menu view looked like:

![menu web view](/../../public/images/menu-view-web.png "menu view")

### After

Now the menu options are created dynamically, based on the elements in the game options hash. And I removed a lot of duplication as well!

![menu web view after](/../../public/images/menu-view-web-after.png "menu view after")

In addition to the numbers and the descriptions which currently exist in the game options hash, I needed the ids, which are formatted in kebab case (yes, this is a technical term, according to my internet research!) like this: human-vs-human (looks like the words are on a kebab, right?).

So I created a helper method in a separate module and the view has access to this method.

The advantage of creating the menu dynamically is not only that it is less work to add new player options but it will also reduce the risk of bugs occuring. 

If another developer were to work on my code, they will probably not know that they have to update the view file along with the player factory and the game options. They would probably figure it out because my code base currently isn't overly big and complex. But if this was a bigger codebase, then it would be harder to figure out or could easily be overlooked. 

## Web controller

### Before

I hardly dare admit it but the web controller had a lot of duplication too. 

In the route for the /game GET request, I called a method with a conditional statement which treated each game option a little different.

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
get '/game' do
    session['board_rows'] ||= Board.new.rows
    if no_game_option_chosen
      erb :error
    else
      play_game_with_computer
      set_template_variables
      erb :game
    end
end

 def play_game_with_computer
    if human_vs_computer_option
      human_vs_computer_game
    elsif computer_vs_human_option
      computer_vs_human_game
    elsif computer_vs_computer_option
      computer_vs_computer_game
    end
 end
  
  
</code></pre>

So to add a random player here, I would have to add another `elsif` condition and then do something.

Having to add another condition here is not very obvious at all. Again, if another developer were to work on this codebase, they could easily overlook it and wonder why they get errors from Sinatra. 


### After

Well, I'm happy to say that I managed to fix this problem and removed a ton of duplication at the same time. The new get request looks like this with a much shorter method (previously called `play_game_with_computer`, now called `current_player_move`)

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
  get '/game' do
    session['board_rows'] ||= Board.new.rows
    if no_game_option_chosen
      erb :error
    else
      current_player_move
      set_template_variables
      erb :game
    end
  end

  def current_player_move
    unless human_vs_human
      if game_in_progress && player_ready
        session['board_rows'] = make_move
      end
    end
  end

</code></pre>

## The result

And now it works! To add a new player option, all you need to do is create the new player with the methods `make_move` and `ready?`, add a new option to the GameOptions class and add the player to the PlayerFactory.

Much simpler than before but it could still be improved.

Felipe raised today that my GameOptions class (remember? all the way at the top of this post!) should not contain strings for each game option as this is a responsibility of the Ui. And that the strings should be dynamically created from the symbols that I have for the game options. I'll have a think about how I can move this responsibility over to the correct class and automatically generate the strings for the ui.
