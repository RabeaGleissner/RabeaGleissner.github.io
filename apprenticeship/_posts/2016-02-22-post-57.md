I was trying to write my long blog post about factory patterns today but then I was too busy breaking and fixing my JavaFX Gui implementation. 

<!--break-->

I’m close to getting it working now but for some reason I’m getting a null pointer exception and I have no idea why. I assume the reason is that it’s 8:30pm and I’m just too tired to write any more code that actually makes sense. 

So I've got my work cut out for me tomorrow - it's going to be another long day.

## Four rules of simple design

Today's Zagaku was on the four rules of simple design. When Christoph started talking about it I didn't remember that I'd actually read that book. The one that uses experiences from Global Day of Code Retreat and derives rules from it. I should read it again with the knowledge that I have now. I'm sure I'll get a lot more out of it than I did last summer.

The rules are that code is good if it:

- passes the test

- expresses intent

- doesn't have any duplication

- has the fewest number of elements possible
