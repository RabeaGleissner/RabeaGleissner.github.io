This morning I continued writing my talk for tomorrow. Once I had finished the slides, I ran through it to practise my delivery.

<!--break-->

The talk is about my apprenticeship, what I’m learning and how. Ultimately I am going to present it at the Ladies of Code meetup but I thought I’d hold it here first. I'll ask for feedback and will hopefully get some good ideas on how to improve it.

At the moment I feel a bit bored by it… I don't know if it's the talk itself or if it is just because I know the subject inside out. Everybody else here at 8th Light does too, so there's the danger of them feeling bored tomorrow!

On the other hand, I assume most attendees at the Ladies of Code meetup don't know anything about our apprenticeship here. So hopefully for them it will be interesting.

I don’t really know how to resolve the potential boredom at the moment - and I don’t really have more time to spend on it either because I need to start learning Elixir.

My plan is to start the koans now and after a couple of hours go back to my talk and run through it again.

I just realised that this blog post was a bit boring too. Maybe I'm just in a boring mood today...
