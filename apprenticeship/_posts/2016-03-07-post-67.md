This morning I gave my first Zagaku session! Zagaku is Japanese for classroom lecture and we (the apprentices) have one of those every morning from Monday to Thursday. Normally these are held by craftsmen but recently some of the apprentices have been asked to also give a Zagaku.

Priya did one on implementing her own HashMap in Java, Maël talked about how to make a website responsive and my session today was on CSS Flexbox. What it is, which problems it solves and how to use it.

It was fun although I felt that I possibly bored my audience a bit… Looking at some of their faces they weren’t very engaged. I tried to increase audience participation by asking them questions, so hopefully that helped to keep them awake.

For the rest of the day I tried to figure out the best way to do the Prime Factors kata in Ruby. I need to do a screen recording of it before my IPM tomorrow. I’ve already done one but I didn’t feel like it was as smooth as it should be. And the requirement is to do it under 6 minutes! At the moment it’s 9 minutes, so I need to see how I shave off some time to achieve that goal.
