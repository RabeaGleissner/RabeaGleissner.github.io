Today I‚Äôm back at it! I‚Äôm taming the beast that is JavaFX and am trying to fit it into my application.

I‚Äôd worked on it with Felipe on Tuesday night and we had left it with a board displaying and a class registering all the clicks that a user was making. So far, so good. We discussed that the next step would be to have the GuiGame class check if a new click has been made and if so, place a mark in that position on the Board class.

This morning I wrote a test for it with a wonderful test double that provides fictitious clicks and then I check if the game is over after all clicks were used up. I wrote the production code for it and the test has a beautiful green colour.

Hm. But I wasn't sure if this would actually work. Jim had mentioned to me that I can‚Äôt have a loop running while at the same time starting the JavaFX thread. And this is exactly what this code was doing - running a loop to check if a new click has been made.

So I wired up the new class and method to Main and started the application. Yay! I created an infinite loop. And the gui window doesn‚Äôt even pop up.

Next I switched around the order in which the GuiGame and the JavaFX window are starting. If I start the JavaFX window first and then the game, the application doesn‚Äôt even enter the loop to check if a new click was made.

Cool üçåüçå.

After lunch I‚Äôll try to update the GuiGame with a clicked position without using a loop.
