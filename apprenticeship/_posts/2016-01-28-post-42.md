I’m going to keep this post short today because I’m feeling a bit under pressure to get my stories done! I think the requirement for the daily blog post is to have at least 100 words, so I’ll stick to that today.

<!--break-->

I still haven’t started coding the alpha-beta pruning because I was busy with some more refactoring based on the feedback I got for my pull requests. And now I only have about 1.5 days left to get it done.

1.5 days doesn't sound too bad when I’m writing it now but knowing myself, I don’t have much faith that I’ll figure the code out quickly. Just based on my traumatic minimax experience… Oh well, I guess there’s always the weekend - although I have other plans, like for example introducing pagination into my 100 days 100 photos page and updating the Ladies Of Code London Github repo.

So little time, so much coding to be done!

Anyway, I better get back to it now.

(This post was 165 words long. I overachieved!)
