When I came into the office this morning, I went through the Prime Factors kata again straight away. And this time I tried to write it from memory as much as possible and only reference the example code to confirm that I was on the right track.

<!--break-->

I surprised myself by how well it went and how much I remembered. And I am slowly getting the feeling that the fog is clearing. When I first looked at the example code on Tuesday, all I could see was what seemed like a more or less random assortment of letters and symbols. 

But now I can see clearly what each line of code does. So Iâ€™m glad to report that I'm making progress.  

I'm also reading and coding along to the book "Test-Driven Development by Example" by Kent Beck. He describes how to test drive a multi-currency application (at the moment the application just multiplies currencies with numbers but I'm only about half way through the example). The good thing is that he describes the process in tiny steps, which makes it possible for me to code along without knowing Java terribly well. 

So I'm slowly warming up to the new language although I feel like I'm still far away from being able to create something with it myself.
