In my last iteration I didn’t have enough time left to write a complete Human vs Human Tic Tac Toe game in Elixir, a language that I hardly know.

<!--break-->

So I suggested that I would create a Tic Tac Toe without a board. Basically just a Ui that asks you to enter a number nine times, then tells you the game is over and asks you if you want to play again.

It wasn’t as easy as I thought it would be though. I especially struggled with testing functions that didn’t return anything. Well, that should have given me a clue that my design was wrong… I’ve had this feedback before and I received it again in my IPM today: if something is hard to test, the design is probably wrong. Somehow I didn’t figure that out - I thought it’s just me who doesn’t know how to write tests in Elixir properly.

Anyway, now I have to create a Human vs Human Tic Tac Toe and Jim asked me to start from scratch again. I don’t really mind throwing away my code actually. I learnt quite a few things from creating that first TTT without a board. For example how to write a mix task to run the code and how to use CaptureIO for testing.

At least now I can start again from a clean slate and I already know a bit more about how to use and test Elixir.
